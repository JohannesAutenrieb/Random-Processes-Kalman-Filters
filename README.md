# Random-Processes-Kalman-Filters
These are a couple of coding assignments I completed for a class on Random Processes and Kalman filters.  It includes an implementation for an EKF for ballistic vehicle tracking and an implementation for an autoregressive model (I used it to forecast jobs in St. Louis).
